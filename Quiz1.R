## Quiz 1

# Question 1
# Consider the data set given below
# x <- c(0.18, -1.54, 0.42, 0.95)
# And weights given by
# w <- c(2, 1, 3, 1)

# Give the value of mu that minimizes the least squares equation sum (1 to n) = wi(xi - u) ^2

    w <- c(2, 1, 3, 1)
    minFun <- function(u) {sum(w * (x - u)^2)}

# Question 2
## Consider the following data set
## x <- c(0.8, 0.47, 0.51, 0.73, 0.36, 0.58, 0.57, 0.85, 0.44, 0.42)

## Fit the regression through the origin and get the slope treating y as 
## the outcome and x as the regressor. (Hint, do not center the data since 
## we want regression through the origin, not through the means of the data.)

# Question 3
# Do data(mtcars) from the datasets package and fit the regression model with 
# mpg as the outcome and weight as the predictor. Give the slope coefficient.


question3 <- function()

}

# Question 4
# Consider data with an outcome (Y) and a predictor (X). 
# The standard deviation of the predictor is one half that of the outcome. 
# The correlation between the two variables is .5. 
# What value would the slope coefficient for the regression model with Y 
# as the outcome and X as the predictor?

# Sd(x) = 0.5 Sd(y)
#
#                Sd(y)            2 Sd(x)
# B1 = C(Y,X) x ------- = 0.5 x ------------= 1
#                Sd(x)              Sd(x)


# Question 5
# Students were given two hard tests and scores were normalized to have empirical
# mean 0 and variance 1. The correlation between the scores on the two tests was 0.4. 
# What would be the expected score on Quiz 2 for a student who had a normalized 
# score of 1.5 on Quiz 1?

# C(Y,X) = 0.4
# SD(X) = SD(Y) = 1
# B0 = 0

# Bo = Y - B1 X
# 0 = Y - 0.4 x 1.5

# Question 6

# Consider the data given by the following

# x <- c(8.58, 10.46, 9.01, 9.64, 8.86)

# What is the value of the first measurement if x were normalized 
# (to have mean 0 and variance 1)?

# Question 7

# Consider the following data set (used above as well). 
# What is the intercept for fitting the model with x as the predictor 
# and y as the outcome?

# x <- c(0.8, 0.47, 0.51, 0.73, 0.36, 0.58, 0.57, 0.85, 0.44, 0.42)

# Question 8
# You know that both the predictor and response have mean 0. 
# What can be said about the intercept when you fit a linear regression?

# Bo = mean(Y) - B1 mean(X) => Bo = 0 - 0 = 0
# It must be identically 0.


# Question 9

# x <- c(0.8, 0.47, 0.51, 0.73, 0.36, 0.58, 0.57, 0.85, 0.44, 0.42)

# What value minimizes the sum of the squared 
# distances between these points and itself?

# Question 10

# Let the slope having fit Y as the outcome and X as the predictor 
# be denoted as B1. Let the slope from fitting X as the outcome and Y 
# as the predictor be denoted as y1. Suppose that you divide B1 by y1; 
# in other words consider B1/y1. What is this ratio always equal to?

#                   Sd(y)
# B1 = cor(y,x) x --------
#                   Sd(x)
